			<h3>Sunday Message</h3>
				<span class="date" style="font-size:12px;"> October 30, 2016</span>
				<span style="font-size:15px; color:green;"><p>By: Widny</p></span>
				<h5>Don't give away what you have.</h5>.</span>

				<p>Know What God is to you.Kow What He's done for you.</p>

				<p>Now as Christian are job is to not be like the people in 2Timothy 3:7.<br>
					"Ever learning, and never coming to the full knowledge of christ."<br>
					Only Qaulified people, who come into the full knowledge of Christ,<br>
					will have a chance to make it.People in the natural government <br>
					would not able to be there if they did not experience.<br>
					Now as Christian it is time to learn all that we need to become a part of the bride of Christ. </p> 

					<span style="font-size:15px; color:green;"><p>By:Noel</p></span>
				<p >The message continue:<br>
				God took us from four point of the earth as it mention in the book of Luke 13:29 .<br>
				He went on, to show we can find the Lord, through faith. In Matthew 8:6-7.<br> The servant went to find Jesus Christ by faith and humble before Him.<br> Brother Noel<br>
				Went on back to the same topic. of 2 Timothy 3 <br> 
				<strong style="color:red;">Things we should not</strong><br>
				"For men shall be lovers of their own selves".
				<ul>
					<li> covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, </li><br>
					<li> disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,</li><br>
                   <li> Without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers</li><br> 
                   <li>incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good,</li><br>
                   <li> Traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God;</li> <br>
				</ul>
				 Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away.<br>
 					For of this sort are they which creep into houses,<br>
				and lead captive silly women laden with sins, led away with divers lusts,<br>
				the faith  of the religion world is set on natural things; houses, money, cars.<br>
				 but as Christain is set on above. that is why we should strive daily <br>
				 and always ask God to help us on the way.<br>
				 Ask for His strenght, strenght for your mind, spirit <br>
				 and so you won't do your own will but God's.<strong>God Bless</strong>
